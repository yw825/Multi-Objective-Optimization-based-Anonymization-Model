# Multi-Objective Optimization Anonymization Model (MO-OBAM) using Particle Swarm Optimization 

Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a multi-objective optimization anonymization model (MO-OBAM) using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The model is designed to optimize the trade-offs between privacy preservation and machine learning performance in structured data.
